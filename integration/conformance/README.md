# Conformance

Contains cross-runtime, cross-renderer, and cross-profile contract suites. These
tests will verify that supported implementations agree on lifecycle, tree
updates, event ordering, capability negotiation, errors, and disposal.

The headless implementation provides a deterministic oracle where appropriate;
host-specific behavior is tested against explicit capability contracts rather
than assumed equivalence.

Status: directory scaffold only.
